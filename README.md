#### The project is being developed using JavaScript Slack (ReactJS and Node). I'm using modern and recent technologies on the development of it, to make the website more sophisticated and different from others. That required me to study new languages and go into new adventures before and while developing it, and that's something I love doing: learning new things and diving into the unknown, and that's why I'm loving developing OnCoffee.

I'm developing it with my friend, he's in charge of coding the front-end in pure HTML and CSS, while I am turning all his pure code into an entire React Project, adding some things and I'm also in charge of coding the back-end completely.

My friend is the one who came with the idea of this project and he was the one who coded all the landpages in the project until now

We're not looking for contributions on this project, but if you think that you can do something to improve it, feel free to contribute
