OnCoffee is an e-commerce plataform that is focused on selling everything related to coffee, from simple coffee bags to coffee preparing machines.

The project is developed using JavaScript stack (ReactJS and Node). I'm using modern and recent technologies on the development of it, to make the website more sophisticated and different from others. That required me to study new languages and go into new adventures before and while developing it, and that's something I love doing: learning new things and diving into the unknown, and that's why I'm loving developing OnCoffee.

I'm developing it with my friend, he's in charge of coding the front-end in pure HTML and CSS, while I am turning all his pure code into an entire React Project, adding some things and I'm also in charge of coding the back-end completely.

My friend is the one who came with the idea of this project and he was the one who coded all the landpages in the project until now
